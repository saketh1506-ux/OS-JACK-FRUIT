2. Build, Load, and Run Instructions
Prerequisites
Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 (bare metal or VM)
Secure Boot OFF (required for kernel module loading)
Linux kernel headers installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
Setup
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/OS-Jackfruit.git
cd OS-Jackfruit
sudo tar -xzf alpine-minirootfs-3.20.3-x86_64.tar.gz -C rootfs-base
sudo tar -xzf alpine-minirootfs-3.20.3-x86_64.tar.gz -C rootfs-alpha

cp cpu_hog memory_hog io_pulse ../rootfs-beta/
Load Module
sudo insmod monitor.ko
ls -l /dev/container_monitor   # verify device exists
dmesg | tail                   # verify "Module loaded"
Run
# Terminal 1 — start supervisor
sudo ./engine supervisor ../rootfs-base
 
# Terminal 2 — launch containers
sudo ./engine start alpha /path/to/rootfs-alpha /bin/sleep 100
sudo ./engine start beta  /path/to/rootfs-beta  /bin/sleep 100
sudo ./engine ps
sudo ./engine logs alpha
sudo ./engine stop alpha
 
# Run in foreground
sudo ./engine run test /path/to/rootfs-alpha /bin/ls
Cleanup
sudo ./engine stop alpha
sudo ./engine stop beta
# Ctrl+C supervisor
sudo rmmod monitor
dmesg | tail   # verify "Module unloaded"

4. Engineering Analysis
Isolation Mechanisms
The runtime uses clone() with CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWUTS | CLONE_NEWNS. Each container gets its own PID namespace (sees itself as PID 1), its own hostname, and its own mount namespace. chroot() locks the container into the Alpine rootfs. /proc is mounted inside the container after chroot so commands like ps work. The host kernel is still shared — all syscalls go through it and the container's PID is visible to the host.

Supervisor and Process Lifecycle
The long-running supervisor is needed to reap exited containers. Without a parent calling waitpid, exited containers become zombies. The supervisor installs a SIGCHLD handler that calls waitpid(-1, WNOHANG) to reap all exited children and update their metadata state. A linked list of container_record_t nodes tracks each container's ID, PID, state, memory limits, and exit status.

IPC, Threads, and Synchronization
Two IPC mechanisms are used. A pipe per container captures stdout/stderr — a producer thread reads from the pipe and pushes into a bounded buffer, and a logging thread pops and writes to log files. A UNIX domain socket at /tmp/mini_runtime.sock handles CLI commands separately from logging.

The bounded buffer uses a mutex and two condition variables (not_full, not_empty). Without the mutex, concurrent producers could corrupt the same buffer slot. Condition variables avoid busy-waiting. The metadata list uses a separate mutex to avoid deadlock between the buffer lock and metadata lock.

Memory Management and Enforcement
RSS measures physical RAM pages currently in use. It does not measure virtual memory, swap, or shared library pages. The soft limit logs a warning once when first exceeded. The hard limit sends SIGKILL. Enforcement is in kernel space because user-space polling can be delayed by the scheduler — a kernel timer fires every second regardless of user-space load.

Scheduling Behavior
Linux CFS assigns CPU time proportional to priority weights derived from nice values. Lower nice = higher weight = more CPU time under contention. I/O-bound processes frequently block and yield the CPU, so CFS gives them a scheduling boost when they wake, making them more responsive despite sharing the CPU with CPU-bound processes.

5. Design Decisions and Tradeoffs
Subsystem	Decision	Tradeoff	Justification
Namespace isolation	PID + UTS + mount only	No network isolation	Network isolation requires veth/bridge setup outside project scope
Supervisor architecture	Single-threaded event loop with select	CLI requests serialized	Simpler than thread-per-client, sufficient for demo scale
IPC/Logging	Pipe per container + UNIX socket	One producer thread per container	Clean separation between logging and control paths
Kernel monitor	Mutex over spinlock	Cannot be held in hard IRQ context	ioctl runs in process context; critical section is short, no sleeping
Scheduling experiments	nice values	Effect only visible under contention	Directly demonstrates CFS weight-based fairness
6. Scheduler Experiment Results
Experiment 1 — CPU-bound, different priorities
Two cpu_hog containers running simultaneously:

Container	Nice	Completion Time
high	-5	~9.120 sec
low	+10	~9.416 sec
The high-priority container finished faster. CFS weight ratio between nice -5 and nice +10 is ~3.5:1, so it received ~3.5x more CPU time under contention.

Experiment 2 — CPU-bound vs I/O-bound
cpu_hog and io_pulse at the same priority. The I/O-bound container blocked frequently on I/O, allowing the CPU-bound container to run during those periods. CFS boosted the I/O container's priority on wakeup, keeping its latency low despite sharing CPU.
